# Deep Learning Model for Ride Prediction

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine
Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow scikeras
```

## Script Overview

### Main Features

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The script loads data from `p4_combined_data.csv`, processes it by converting dates and extracting weekend information.
- **Feature Selection and Normalization**: Selects 'Daily_Cases' and 'Is_Weekend' as features and applies standard normalization.
- **Neural Network Model**: Builds a Sequential model with Dense layers, Dropout, and L2 regularization.
- **K-Fold Cross-Validation**: Implements 5-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance.

### Model Architecture

- The model consists of a Sequential Keras model with multiple Dense layers.
- It uses dropout and L2 regularization to reduce overfitting.
- The loss function used is Mean Squared Error, optimized using the Adam optimizer.

## Usage
## Data Requirements

The script expects a CSV file named `p4_combined_data.csv` with columns for 'Daily_Cases', 'Start_Date', and 'Total_Rides'.

## Results

The script outputs the cross-validated mean squared error (MSE) and its standard deviation, providing an estimate of the model's prediction accuracy.
